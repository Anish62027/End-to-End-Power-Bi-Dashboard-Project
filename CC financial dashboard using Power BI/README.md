## 📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive **Credit Card Financial Dashboard** using **Power BI**. It leverages SQL-based transaction and customer data to provide **real-time insights** into financial trends, helping businesses make informed decisions.

## 🗄️ Data from SQL
The financial transaction data is stored in a **SQL database**, ensuring structured data management and efficient querying for analysis.

### 🚀 Import Data to SQL Database
1️⃣ **Prepare CSV File** – Organize financial transaction & customer data.  
2️⃣ **Create Tables in SQL** – Define appropriate table structures.  
3️⃣ **Import CSV into SQL** – Load data for analysis using SQL queries.

## 🛠 Data Processing & DAX
Once the data is in SQL, we use **Power BI** to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data for dashboard visualization. Key processing steps:
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning & transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom measures & calculations  
- **SQL Queries** – Data retrieval & filtering for insights
